## Oddsquare
Odds square the affirmation that if you sum an array of positive and consicutive odds number it will equal the square of the lenght of the said array. 

Exemple:
if you take 1+3+5 = 9
there are 3 number to some 
and 3 square equal also 9.

So i create a Python code to test if it's always true. 
5 min in and my logs says:
47933 of odds pass in 0.007035732269287109

So I would say it's true.
